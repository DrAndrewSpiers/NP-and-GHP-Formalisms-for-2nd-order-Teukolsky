# NP-and-GHP-Formalisms-for-2nd-order-Teukolsky
 
Notebook adapted and built on from "The N.P. and G.H.P. formalisms."  Alfonso García-Parrado Gómez-Lobo, Universidade do Minho, Portugal, September 2009, http://www.xact.es/Documentation/English/PublicNPGHP.nb.  
The specific parts of this notebook which were adapted from "The N.P. and G.H.P. formalisms." are the "Newman Penrose Formalism" (apart from the Teukolsky derivation sections) and "GHP Formalism" chapters in the "Set up Notebook" section. The rest of this notebook was created by the author, Andrew Spiers. Additionally, the results in the "Results" section have been checked against results produced by Jordan Moxon.

The motivation for adapting García-Parrado Gómez-Lobo's notebook began to produce a self contained Mathematica notebook in the positive metric signature based on the tetrad being the fundamental objects (whereas García-Parrado Gómez-Lobo's notebook is in a negative metric signature with spin Dyad spinors as fundamental objects).
